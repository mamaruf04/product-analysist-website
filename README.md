* To build the website i used some Vanilla CSS and Bootstrap.
* i creat a fake data base for reviews.
* my fake data base link is here: https://my-json-server.typicode.com/mamaruf04/mockjson/profile
* i also use p-hero's data which was given with assignment repo.
* finally i have deployed my react-site's 'build' file in netlify.
